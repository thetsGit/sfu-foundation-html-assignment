        <p>Australia is the sixth-largest country in the world. It is also one of the driest continents on earth. Its huge landmass offers a varied landscape of deserts, tropical rainforests, and
        mountain ranges. Australia is famous for its Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef in the world.
        An island continent, it is surrounded by the <span class="emphasis">Indian</span> and <span class="emphasis">Pacific Oceans</span>. It
        includes the Australian mainland, the island of <span class="emphasis">Tasmania</span>, and other small islands.
        </p>
        <p>
        Australia's unique geographic position and centuries of isolation created ecosystems that are unique in the world. Of its flora and fauna, 84% of its mammals, 45% of its birds,
        93% of its reptiles and 90% of its fish are endemic. Australia has 755 species of reptile, which is more than any country in the world.
