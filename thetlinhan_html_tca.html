        mountain ranges. Australia is famous for its Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef in the world.
        An island continent, it is surrounded by the <span class="emphasis">Indian</span> and <span class="emphasis">Pacific Oceans</span> . It
        includes the Australian mainland, the island of <span class="emphasis">Tasmania</span> , and other small islands.
        </p>
        <p>
        Australia's unique geographic position and centuries of isolation created ecosystems that are unique in the world. Of its flora and fauna, 84% of its mammals, 45% of its birds,
        93% of its reptiles and 90% of its fish are endemic. Australia has 755 species of reptile, which is more than any country in the world.
